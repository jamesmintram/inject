# Teeny Tiny Injection 

A very simple library for providing me with enough features for what I need. This library will grow as I need more features and fix bugs while using it.

### Why?

I Created this as an alternative to github.com/facebookgo/inject due to the "patent" restrictions placed upon that code.
